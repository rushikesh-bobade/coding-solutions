# Number of Ways to Assign Edge Weights II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either** 1** or** 2**.

The** cost** of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [ui, vi]`, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges** in the path** such that the cost of the path between `ui` and `vi` is** odd**.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply** modulo** `109 + 7` to each `answer[i]`.** Note:** For each query, disregard all edges** not** in the path between node `ui` and `vi`.** Example 1:** **Input:** edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]** Output:** [0,1]** Explanation:** - Query [1,1]: The path from Node 1 to itself consists of no edges, so the cost is 0. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 0.
- Query [1,2]: The path from Node 1 to Node 2 consists of one edge (1 → 2). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.** Example 2:** **Input:** edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], queries = [[1,4],[3,4],[2,5]]** Output:** [2,1,4]** Explanation:** - Query [1,4]: The path from Node 1 to Node 4 consists of two edges (1 → 3 and 3 → 4). Assigning weights (1,2) or (2,1) results in an odd cost. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 2.
- Query [3,4]: The path from Node 3 to Node 4 consists of one edge (3 → 4). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.
- Query [2,5]: The path from Node 2 to Node 5 consists of three edges (2 → 1, 1 → 3, and 3 → 5). Assigning (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), or (1,1,1) makes the cost odd. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 4.** Constraints:** - 2 <= n <= 105
- edges.length == n - 1
- edges[i] == [ui, vi]
- 1 <= queries.length <= 105
- queries[i] == [ui, vi]
- 1 <= ui, vi <= n
- edges represents a valid tree.
