# Flip Square Submatrix Vertically

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `x`, `y`, and `k`.

The integers `x` and `y` represent the row and column indices of the  **top-left**  corner of a  **square**  submatrix and the integer `k` represents the size (side length) of the square submatrix.

Your task is to flip the submatrix by reversing the order of its rows vertically.

Return the updated matrix.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], x = 1, y = 0, k = 3

 **Output:**  [[1,2,3,4],[13,14,15,8],[9,10,11,12],[5,6,7,16]]

 **Explanation:** 

The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.

 **Example 2:** 

​​​​​​​

 **Input:**  grid = [[3,4,2,3],[2,3,4,2]], x = 0, y = 2, k = 2

 **Output:**  [[3,4,4,2],[2,3,2,3]]

 **Explanation:** 

The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
- 0 <= x < m
- 0 <= y < n
- 1 <= k <= min(m - x, n - y)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reverseSubmatrix(int[][] grid, int x, int y, int k) {

        int top = x;
        int bottom = x + k - 1;

        while (top < bottom) {

            for (int col = y; col < y + k; col++) {
                int temp = grid[top][col];
                grid[top][col] = grid[bottom][col];
                grid[bottom][col] = temp;
            }

            top++;
            bottom--;
        }

        return grid;
    }
}
```
