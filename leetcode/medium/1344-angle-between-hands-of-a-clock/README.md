![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return *the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the *`hour`* and the *`minute`* hand*.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

 

**Example 1:**


```
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165

```


**Example 2:**


```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75

```


**Example 3:**


```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5

```


 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= hour <= 12`
`0 <= minutes <= 59`

```java
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {

        double minuteAngle = minutes * 6.0;

        double hourAngle = (hour % 12) * 30.0 + minutes * 0.5;

        double diff = Math.abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle);

        return Math.min(diff, 360.0 - diff);
    }
}
```
