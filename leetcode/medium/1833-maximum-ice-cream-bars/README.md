# Maximum Ice Cream Bars

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are `n` ice cream bars. You are given an array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the price of the `ith` ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has `coins` coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible. 

 **Note:**  The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

Return  *the  **maximum**  number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with* `coins` *coins.* 

You must solve the problem by counting sort.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- costs.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 1 <= costs[i] <= 105
- 1 <= coins <= 108

            maxCost = Math.max(maxCost, cost);
        }
        
        int[] count = new int[maxCost + 1];
        
        for (int cost : costs) {
            count[cost]++;
        }
        
        int bars = 0;

            int totalCost = cost * count[cost];
            
            if (coins >= totalCost) {
                bars += count[cost];
                coins -= totalCost;
            } else {
                bars += coins / cost;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return bars;
    }
}
