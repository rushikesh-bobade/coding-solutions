# Array Leaders

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array  **`arr`**  of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

**Examples:
**

```
Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.

```

```
Input: arr = [10, 4, 2, 4, 1]
Output: [10, 4, 4, 1]
Explanation: Note that both of the 4s are in output, as to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right. side
```

```
Input: arr = [5, 10, 20, 40]
Output: [40]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in increasing order, only the rightmost element is leader.
```

```
Input: arr = [30, 10, 10, 5]
Output: [30, 10, 10, 5]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in non-increasing order, all elements are leaders.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 106

```java
class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Integer> leaders(int arr[]) {
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int n = arr.length;
        int maxSoFar = arr[n - 1];
        
        result.add(maxSoFar);
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] >= maxSoFar) {
                maxSoFar = arr[i];
                result.add(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        
        Collections.reverse(result);
        return result;
    }
}
```
