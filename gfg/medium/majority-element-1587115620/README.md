# Majority Element

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**. Find the  **majority element**  in the array. If no majority element exists, return  **-1**.

 **Note:**  A majority element in an array is an element that appears  **strictly** more than **arr.size()/2** times in the array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since, 1 is present more than 7/2 times, so it is the majority element.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [7]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since, 7 is single element and present more than 1/2 times, so it is the majority element.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 13]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, no element is present more than 2/2 times, so there is no majority element.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

```java
class Solution {
    static int majorityElement(int arr[]) {
        int candidate = -1;
        int count = 0;

        // Find candidate
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
                count = 1;
            } else if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        // Verify candidate
        count = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count > arr.length / 2 ? candidate : -1;
    }
}
```
